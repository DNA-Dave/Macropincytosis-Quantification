# Macropincytosis-Quantification
Macropinocytosis, a process where cells aquire nutrients from their extracellural enviroment, has been found to be increased in many types of cancers, including lung cancer. Therefore, it is important for scientists to be able to have quick and easy ways of quantifying this process when studying the effects or various drugs. The traditional way of quantifying macropinocytosis is to manually count macropinosomes in each picture captured by the microscope. However, when hundreds of pictures are taken, this method becomes impractical. Therefore, this project developed a Python script that automatically quantifies, aggregates, graphs macropinocytosis in various treatment groups for a particular experiment. The tool also allows easy comparisons between groups in order to establish statistical signficance, allowing for fast and high throughput analysis of macropinocytosis data.
